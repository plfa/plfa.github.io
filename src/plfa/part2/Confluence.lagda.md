## Introduction

In this chapter we prove that beta reduction is _confluent_, a
property also known as _Church-Rosser_. That is, if there are
reduction sequences from any term `L` to two different terms `M₁` and
`M₂`, then there exist reduction sequences from those two terms to
some common term `N`. In pictures:

        L
       / \
      /   \
     /     \
    M₁      M₂
     \     /
      \   /
       \ /
        N

where downward lines are instances of `—↠`.

Confluence is studied in many other kinds of rewrite systems besides
the lambda calculus, and it is well known how to prove confluence in
rewrite systems that enjoy the _diamond property_, a single-step
version of confluence. Let `⇛` be a relation.  Then `⇛` has the
diamond property if whenever `L ⇛ M₁` and `L ⇛ M₂`, then there exists
an `N` such that `M₁ ⇛ N` and `M₂ ⇛ N`. This is just an instance of
the same picture above, where downward lines are now instance of `⇛`.
If we write `⇛*` for the reflexive and transitive closure of `⇛`, then
confluence of `⇛*` follows immediately from the diamond property.

Unfortunately, reduction in the lambda calculus does not satisfy the
diamond property. Here is a counter example.

    (λ x. x x)((λ x. x) a) —→ (λ x. x x) a
    (λ x. x x)((λ x. x) a) —→ ((λ x. x) a) ((λ x. x) a)

Both terms can reduce to `a a`, but the second term requires two steps
to get there, not one.

To side-step this problem, we'll define an auxiliary reduction
relation, called _parallel reduction_, that can perform many
reductions simultaneously and thereby satisfy the diamond property.
Furthermore, we show that a parallel reduction sequence exists between
any two terms if and only if a beta reduction sequence exists between them.
Thus, we can reduce the proof of confluence for beta reduction to
confluence for parallel reduction.

## Parallel Reduction

The parallel reduction relation is defined as follows.

```agda
infix 2 _⇛_

data _⇛_ : ∀ {Γ A} → (Γ ⊢ A) → (Γ ⊢ A) → Set where

  pvar : ∀{Γ A}{x : Γ ∋ A}
      ---------
    → (` x) ⇛ (` x)

  pabs : ∀{Γ}{N N′ : Γ , ★ ⊢ ★}
    → N ⇛ N′
      ----------
    → ƛ N ⇛ ƛ N′

  papp : ∀{Γ}{L L′ M M′ : Γ ⊢ ★}
    → L ⇛ L′
    → M ⇛ M′
      -----------------
    → L · M ⇛ L′ · M′

  pbeta : ∀{Γ}{N N′  : Γ , ★ ⊢ ★}{M M′ : Γ ⊢ ★}
    → N ⇛ N′
    → M ⇛ M′
      -----------------------
    → (ƛ N) · M  ⇛  N′ [ M′ ]
```
The first three rules are congruences that reduce each of their
parts simultaneously. The last rule reduces a lambda term and
term in parallel followed by a beta step.

We remark that the `pabs`, `papp`, and `pbeta` rules perform reduction
on all their subexpressions simultaneously. Also, the `pabs` rule is
akin to the `ζ` rule and `pbeta` is akin to `β`.

Parallel reduction is reflexive.

```agda
par-refl : ∀{Γ A}{M : Γ ⊢ A} → M ⇛ M
par-refl {Γ} {A} {` x} = pvar
par-refl {Γ} {★} {ƛ N} = pabs par-refl
par-refl {Γ} {★} {L · M} = papp par-refl par-refl
```
We define the sequences of parallel reduction as follows.

```agda
infix  2 _⇛*_
infixr 2 _⇛⟨_⟩_
infix  3 _∎

data _⇛*_ : ∀ {Γ A} → (Γ ⊢ A) → (Γ ⊢ A) → Set where

  _∎ : ∀ {Γ A} (M : Γ ⊢ A)
      --------
    → M ⇛* M

  _⇛⟨_⟩_ : ∀ {Γ A} (L : Γ ⊢ A) {M N : Γ ⊢ A}
    → L ⇛ M
    → M ⇛* N
      ---------
    → L ⇛* N
```


#### Exercise `par-diamond-eg` (practice)

Revisit the counter example to the diamond property for reduction by
showing that the diamond property holds for parallel reduction in that
case.

## Equivalence between parallel reduction and reduction

Here we prove that for any `M` and `N`, `M ⇛* N` if and only if `M —↠ N`.
The only-if direction is particularly easy. We start by showing
that if `M —→ N`, then `M ⇛ N`. The proof is by induction on
the reduction `M —→ N`.

```agda
beta-par : ∀{Γ A}{M N : Γ ⊢ A}
  → M —→ N
    ------
  → M ⇛ N
beta-par {Γ} {★} {L · M} (ξ₁ r) = papp (beta-par {M = L} r) par-refl
beta-par {Γ} {★} {L · M} (ξ₂ r) = papp par-refl (beta-par {M = M} r)
beta-par {Γ} {★} {(ƛ N) · M} β = pbeta par-refl par-refl
beta-par {Γ} {★} {ƛ N} (ζ r) = pabs (beta-par r)
```

With this lemma in hand we complete the only-if direction,
that `M —↠ N` implies `M ⇛* N`. The proof is a straightforward
induction on the reduction sequence `M —↠ N`.

```agda
betas-pars : ∀{Γ A} {M N : Γ ⊢ A}
  → M —↠ N
    ------
  → M ⇛* N
betas-pars {Γ} {A} {M₁} {.M₁} (M₁ ∎) = M₁ ∎
betas-pars {Γ} {A} {.L} {N} (L —→⟨ b ⟩ bs) =
   L ⇛⟨ beta-par b ⟩ betas-pars bs
```

Now for the other direction, that `M ⇛* N` implies `M —↠ N`.  The
proof of this direction is a bit different because it's not the case
that `M ⇛ N` implies `M —→ N`. After all, `M ⇛ N` performs many
reductions. So instead we shall prove that `M ⇛ N` implies `M —↠ N`.

```agda
par-betas : ∀{Γ A}{M N : Γ ⊢ A}
  → M ⇛ N
    ------
  → M —↠ N
par-betas {Γ} {A} {.(` _)} (pvar{x = x}) = (` x) ∎
par-betas {Γ} {★} {ƛ N} (pabs p) = abs-cong (par-betas p)
par-betas {Γ} {★} {L · M} (papp {L = L}{L′}{M}{M′} p₁ p₂) =
    begin
    L · M   —↠⟨ appL-cong{M = M} (par-betas p₁) ⟩
    L′ · M  —↠⟨ appR-cong (par-betas p₂) ⟩
    L′ · M′
    ∎
par-betas {Γ} {★} {(ƛ N) · M} (pbeta{N′ = N′}{M′ = M′} p₁ p₂) =
    begin
    (ƛ N) · M                    —↠⟨ appL-cong{M = M} (abs-cong (par-betas p₁)) ⟩
    (ƛ N′) · M                   —↠⟨ appR-cong{L = ƛ N′} (par-betas p₂)  ⟩
    (ƛ N′) · M′                  —→⟨ β ⟩
     N′ [ M′ ]
    ∎
```

The proof is by induction on `M ⇛ N`.

* Suppose `x ⇛ x`. We immediately have `x —↠ x`.

* Suppose `ƛ N ⇛ ƛ N′` because `N ⇛ N′`. By the induction hypothesis
  we have `N —↠ N′`. We conclude that `ƛ N —↠ ƛ N′` because
  `—↠` is a congruence.

* Suppose `L · M ⇛ L′ · M′` because `L ⇛ L′` and `M ⇛ M′`.
  By the induction hypothesis, we have `L —↠ L′` and `M —↠ M′`.
  So `L · M —↠ L′ · M` and then `L′ · M  —↠ L′ · M′`
  because `—↠` is a congruence.

* Suppose `(ƛ N) · M  ⇛  N′ [ M′ ]` because `N ⇛ N′` and `M ⇛ M′`.
  By similar reasoning, we have
  `(ƛ N) · M —↠ (ƛ N′) · M′`
  which we can following with the β reduction
  `(ƛ N′) · M′ —→ N′ [ M′ ]`.

With this lemma in hand, we complete the proof that `M ⇛* N` implies
`M —↠ N` with a simple induction on `M ⇛* N`.

```agda
pars-betas : ∀{Γ A} {M N : Γ ⊢ A}
  → M ⇛* N
    ------
  → M —↠ N
pars-betas (M₁ ∎) = M₁ ∎
pars-betas (L ⇛⟨ p ⟩ ps) = —↠-trans (par-betas p) (pars-betas ps)
```


## Substitution lemma for parallel reduction

Our next goal is to prove the diamond property for parallel
reduction. But to do that, we need to prove that substitution
respects parallel reduction. That is, if
`N ⇛ N′` and `M ⇛ M′`, then `N [ M ] ⇛ N′ [ M′ ]`.
We cannot prove this directly by induction, so we
generalize it to: if `N ⇛ N′` and
the substitution `σ` pointwise parallel reduces to `τ`,
then `subst σ N ⇛ subst τ N′`. We define the notion
of pointwise parallel reduction as follows.

```agda
par-subst : ∀{Γ Δ} → Subst Γ Δ → Subst Γ Δ → Set
par-subst {Γ}{Δ} σ σ′ = ∀{A}{x : Γ ∋ A} → σ x ⇛ σ′ x
```

Because substitution depends on the extension function `exts`, which
in turn relies on `rename`, we start with a version of the
substitution lemma, called `par-rename`, that is specialized to
renamings.  The proof of `par-rename` relies on the fact that renaming
and substitution commute with one another, which is a lemma that we
import from Chapter [Substitution](/Substitution/)
and restate here.

```agda
rename-subst-commute : ∀{Γ Δ}{N : Γ , ★ ⊢ ★}{M : Γ ⊢ ★}{ρ : Rename Γ Δ }
    → (rename (ext ρ) N) [ rename ρ M ] ≡ rename ρ (N [ M ])
rename-subst-commute {N = N} = plfa.part2.Substitution.rename-subst-commute {N = N}
```

Now for the `par-rename` lemma.

```agda
par-rename : ∀{Γ Δ A} {ρ : Rename Γ Δ} {M M′ : Γ ⊢ A}
  → M ⇛ M′
    ------------------------
  → rename ρ M ⇛ rename ρ M′
par-rename pvar = pvar
par-rename (pabs p) = pabs (par-rename p)
par-rename (papp p₁ p₂) = papp (par-rename p₁) (par-rename p₂)
par-rename {Γ}{Δ}{A}{ρ} (pbeta{Γ}{N}{N′}{M}{M′} p₁ p₂)
    with pbeta (par-rename{ρ = ext ρ} p₁) (par-rename{ρ = ρ} p₂)
... | G rewrite rename-subst-commute{Γ}{Δ}{N′}{M′}{ρ} = G

```

The proof is by induction on `M ⇛ M′`. The first three cases
are straightforward so we just consider the last one for `pbeta`.

* Suppose `(ƛ N) · M  ⇛  N′ [ M′ ]` because `N ⇛ N′` and `M ⇛ M′`.
  By the induction hypothesis, we have
  `rename (ext ρ) N ⇛ rename (ext ρ) N′` and
  `rename ρ M ⇛ rename ρ M′`.
  So by `pbeta` we have
  `(ƛ rename (ext ρ) N) · (rename ρ M) ⇛ (rename (ext ρ) N) [ rename ρ M ]`.
  However, to conclude we instead need parallel reduction to
  `rename ρ (N [ M ])`. But thankfully, renaming and substitution
  commute with one another.


With the `par-rename` lemma in hand, it is straightforward to show
that extending substitutions preserves the pointwise parallel
reduction relation.

```agda
par-subst-exts : ∀{Γ Δ} {σ τ : Subst Γ Δ}
  → par-subst σ τ
    ------------------------------------------
  → ∀{B} → par-subst (exts σ {B = B}) (exts τ)
par-subst-exts s {x = Z} = pvar
par-subst-exts s {x = S x} = par-rename s
```

The next lemma that we need for proving that substitution respects
parallel reduction is the following which states that
simultaneous substitution commutes with single substitution. We import this
lemma from Chapter [Substitution](/Substitution/)
and restate it below.

```agda
subst-commute : ∀{Γ Δ}{N : Γ , ★ ⊢ ★}{M : Γ ⊢ ★}{σ : Subst Γ Δ }
  → subst (exts σ) N [ subst σ M ] ≡ subst σ (N [ M ])
subst-commute {N = N} = plfa.part2.Substitution.subst-commute {N = N}
```

We are ready to prove that substitution respects parallel reduction.

```agda
subst-par : ∀{Γ Δ A} {σ τ : Subst Γ Δ} {M M′ : Γ ⊢ A}
  → par-subst σ τ  →  M ⇛ M′
    --------------------------
  → subst σ M ⇛ subst τ M′
subst-par {Γ} {Δ} {A} {σ} {τ} {` x} s pvar = s
subst-par {Γ} {Δ} {A} {σ} {τ} {ƛ N} s (pabs p) =
  pabs (subst-par {σ = exts σ} {τ = exts τ}
        (λ {A}{x} → par-subst-exts s {x = x}) p)
subst-par {Γ} {Δ} {★} {σ} {τ} {L · M} s (papp p₁ p₂) =
  papp (subst-par s p₁) (subst-par s p₂)
subst-par {Γ} {Δ} {★} {σ} {τ} {(ƛ N) · M} s (pbeta{N′ = N′}{M′ = M′} p₁ p₂)
    with pbeta (subst-par{σ = exts σ}{τ = exts τ}{M = N}
                        (λ{A}{x} → par-subst-exts s {x = x}) p₁)
               (subst-par {σ = σ} s p₂)
... | G rewrite subst-commute{N = N′}{M = M′}{σ = τ} = G
```

We proceed by induction on `M ⇛ M′`.

* Suppose `x ⇛ x`. We conclude that `σ x ⇛ τ x` using
  the premise `par-subst σ τ`.

* Suppose `ƛ N ⇛ ƛ N′` because `N ⇛ N′`.
  To use the induction hypothesis, we need `par-subst (exts σ) (exts τ)`,
  which we obtain by `par-subst-exts`.
  So we have `subst (exts σ) N ⇛ subst (exts τ) N′`
  and conclude by rule `pabs`.

* Suppose `L · M ⇛ L′ · M′` because `L ⇛ L′` and `M ⇛ M′`.
  By the induction hypothesis we have
  `subst σ L ⇛ subst τ L′` and `subst σ M ⇛ subst τ M′`, so
  we conclude by rule `papp`.

* Suppose `(ƛ N) · M  ⇛  N′ [ M′ ]` because `N ⇛ N′` and `M ⇛ M′`.
  Again we obtain `par-subst (exts σ) (exts τ)` by `par-subst-exts`.
  So by the induction hypothesis, we have
  `subst (exts σ) N ⇛ subst (exts τ) N′` and
  `subst σ M ⇛ subst τ M′`. Then by rule `pbeta`, we have parallel reduction
  to `subst (exts τ) N′ [ subst τ M′ ]`.
  Substitution commutes with itself in the following sense.
  For any σ, N, and M, we have

        (subst (exts σ) N) [ subst σ M ] ≡ subst σ (N [ M ])

  So we have parallel reduction to `subst τ (N′ [ M′ ])`.


Of course, if `M ⇛ M′`, then `subst-zero M` pointwise parallel reduces
to `subst-zero M′`.

```agda
par-subst-zero : ∀{Γ}{A}{M M′ : Γ ⊢ A}
       → M ⇛ M′
       → par-subst (subst-zero M) (subst-zero M′)
par-subst-zero {M} {M′} p {A} {Z} = p
par-subst-zero {M} {M′} p {A} {S x} = pvar
```

We conclude this section with the desired corollary, that substitution
respects parallel reduction.

```agda
sub-par : ∀{Γ A B} {N N′ : Γ , A ⊢ B} {M M′ : Γ ⊢ A}
  → N ⇛ N′
  → M ⇛ M′
    --------------------------
  → N [ M ] ⇛ N′ [ M′ ]
sub-par pn pm = subst-par (par-subst-zero pm) pn
```

## Parallel reduction satisfies the diamond property

The heart of the confluence proof is made of stone, or rather, of
diamond!  We show that parallel reduction satisfies the diamond
property: that if `M ⇛ N` and `M ⇛ N′`, then `N ⇛ L` and `N′ ⇛ L` for
some `L`.  The typical proof is an induction on `M ⇛ N` and `M ⇛ N′`
so that every possible pair gives rise to a witness `L` given by
performing enough beta reductions in parallel.

However, a simpler approach is to perform as many beta reductions in
parallel as possible on `M`, say `M ⁺`, and then show that `N` also
parallel reduces to `M ⁺`. This is the idea of Takahashi's _complete
development_. The desired property may be illustrated as

        M
       /|
      / |
     /  |
    N   2
     \  |
      \ |
       \|
        M⁺

where downward lines are instances of `⇛`, so we call it the _triangle
property_.

```agda
_⁺ : ∀ {Γ A}
  → Γ ⊢ A → Γ ⊢ A
(` x) ⁺       =  ` x
(ƛ M) ⁺       = ƛ (M ⁺)
((ƛ N) · M) ⁺ = N ⁺ [ M ⁺ ]
(L · M) ⁺     = L ⁺ · (M ⁺)

par-triangle : ∀ {Γ A} {M N : Γ ⊢ A}
  → M ⇛ N
    -------
  → N ⇛ M ⁺
par-triangle pvar          = pvar
par-triangle (pabs p)      = pabs (par-triangle p)
par-triangle (pbeta p1 p2) = sub-par (par-triangle p1) (par-triangle p2)
par-triangle (papp {L = ƛ _ } (pabs p1) p2) =
  pbeta (par-triangle p1) (par-triangle p2)
par-triangle (papp {L = ` _}   p1 p2) = papp (par-triangle p1) (par-triangle p2)
par-triangle (papp {L = _ · _} p1 p2) = papp (par-triangle p1) (par-triangle p2)
```

The proof of the triangle property is an induction on `M ⇛ N`.

* Suppose `x ⇛ x`. Clearly `x ⁺ = x`, so `x ⇛ x ⁺`.

* Suppose `ƛ M ⇛ ƛ N`. By the induction hypothesis we have `N ⇛ M ⁺`
  and by definition `(λ M) ⁺ = λ (M ⁺)`, so we conclude that `λ N ⇛ λ
  (M ⁺)`.

* Suppose `(λ N) · M ⇛ N′ [ M′ ]`. By the induction hypothesis, we have
  `N′ ⇛ N ⁺` and `M′ ⇛ M ⁺`. Since substitution respects parallel reduction,
  it follows that `N′ [ M′ ] ⇛ N ⁺ [ M ⁺ ]`, but the right hand side
  is exactly `((λ N) · M) ⁺`, hence `N′ [ M′ ] ⇛ ((λ N) · M) ⁺`.

* Suppose `(λ L) · M ⇛ (λ L′) · M′`. By the induction hypothesis
  we have `L′ ⇛ L ⁺` and `M′ ⇛ M ⁺`; by definition `((λ L) · M) ⁺ = L ⁺ [ M ⁺ ]`.
  It follows `(λ L′) · M′ ⇛ L ⁺ [ M ⁺ ]`.

* Suppose `x · M ⇛ x · M′`. By the induction hypothesis we have `M′ ⇛ M ⁺`
  and `x ⇛ x ⁺` so that `x · M′ ⇛ x · M ⁺`.
  The remaining case is proved in the same way, so we ignore it.  (As
  there is currently no way in Agda to expand the catch-all pattern in
  the definition of `_⁺` for us before checking the right-hand side,
  we have to write down the remaining case explicitly.)

The diamond property then follows by halving the diamond into two triangles.

        M
       /|\
      / | \
     /  |  \
    N   2   N′
     \  |  /
      \ | /
       \|/
        M⁺

That is, the diamond property is proved by applying the
triangle property on each side with the same confluent term `M ⁺`.

```agda
par-diamond : ∀{Γ A} {M N N′ : Γ ⊢ A}
  → M ⇛ N
  → M ⇛ N′
    ---------------------------------
  → Σ[ L ∈ Γ ⊢ A ] (N ⇛ L) × (N′ ⇛ L)
par-diamond {M = M} p1 p2 = ⟨ M ⁺ , ⟨ par-triangle p1 , par-triangle p2 ⟩ ⟩
```

This step is optional, though, in the presence of triangle property.

#### Exercise (practice)

* Prove the diamond property `par-diamond` directly by induction on `M ⇛ N` and `M ⇛ N′`.

* Draw pictures that represent the proofs of each of the six cases in
  the direct proof of `par-diamond`. The pictures should consist of nodes
  and directed edges, where each node is labeled with a term and each
  edge represents parallel reduction.

## Proof of confluence for parallel reduction

As promised at the beginning, the proof that parallel reduction is
confluent is easy now that we know it satisfies the triangle property.
We just need to prove the strip lemma, which states that
if `M ⇛ N` and `M ⇛* N′`, then
`N ⇛* L` and `N′ ⇛ L` for some `L`.
The following diagram illustrates the strip lemma

        M
       / \
      1   *
     /     \
    N       N′
     \     /
      *   1
       \ /
        L

where downward lines are instances of `⇛` or `⇛*`, depending on how
they are marked.

The proof of the strip lemma is a straightforward induction on `M ⇛* N′`,
using the triangle property in the induction step.

```agda
strip : ∀{Γ A} {M N N′ : Γ ⊢ A}
  → M ⇛ N
  → M ⇛* N′
    ------------------------------------
  → Σ[ L ∈ Γ ⊢ A ] (N ⇛* L)  ×  (N′ ⇛ L)
strip{Γ}{A}{M}{N}{N′} mn (M ∎) = ⟨ N , ⟨ N ∎ , mn ⟩ ⟩
strip{Γ}{A}{M}{N}{N′} mn (M ⇛⟨ mm' ⟩ m'n')
  with strip (par-triangle mm') m'n'
... | ⟨ L , ⟨ ll' , n'l' ⟩ ⟩ = ⟨ L , ⟨ N ⇛⟨ par-triangle mn ⟩ ll' , n'l' ⟩ ⟩
```

The proof of confluence for parallel reduction is now proved by
induction on the sequence `M ⇛* N`, using the above lemma in the
induction step.

```agda
par-confluence : ∀{Γ A} {L M₁ M₂ : Γ ⊢ A}
  → L ⇛* M₁
  → L ⇛* M₂
    ------------------------------------
  → Σ[ N ∈ Γ ⊢ A ] (M₁ ⇛* N) × (M₂ ⇛* N)
par-confluence {Γ}{A}{L}{.L}{N} (L ∎) L⇛*N = ⟨ N , ⟨ L⇛*N , N ∎ ⟩ ⟩
par-confluence {Γ}{A}{L}{M₁′}{M₂} (L ⇛⟨ L⇛M₁ ⟩ M₁⇛*M₁′) L⇛*M₂
    with strip L⇛M₁ L⇛*M₂
... | ⟨ N , ⟨ M₁⇛*N , M₂⇛N ⟩ ⟩
      with par-confluence M₁⇛*M₁′ M₁⇛*N
...   | ⟨ N′ , ⟨ M₁′⇛*N′ , N⇛*N′ ⟩ ⟩ =
        ⟨ N′ , ⟨ M₁′⇛*N′ , (M₂ ⇛⟨ M₂⇛N ⟩ N⇛*N′) ⟩ ⟩
```

The step case may be illustrated as follows:

            L
           / \
          1   *
         /     \
        M₁ (a)  M₂
       / \     /
      *   *   1
     /     \ /
    M₁′(b)  N
     \     /
      *   *
       \ /
        N′

where downward lines are instances of `⇛` or `⇛*`, depending on how
they are marked. Here `(a)` holds by `strip` and `(b)` holds by
induction.


## Proof of confluence for reduction

Confluence of reduction is a corollary of confluence for parallel
reduction. From
`L —↠ M₁` and `L —↠ M₂` we have
`L ⇛* M₁` and `L ⇛* M₂` by `betas-pars`.
Then by confluence we obtain some `L` such that
`M₁ ⇛* N` and `M₂ ⇛* N`, from which we conclude that
`M₁ —↠ N` and `M₂ —↠ N` by `pars-betas`.

```agda
confluence : ∀{Γ A} {L M₁ M₂ : Γ ⊢ A}
  → L —↠ M₁
  → L —↠ M₂
    -----------------------------------

## Notes

Broadly speaking, this proof of confluence, based on parallel
reduction, is due to W. Tait and P. Martin-Löf (see Barendregt 1984,
Section 3.2).  Details of the mechanization come from several sources.
The `subst-par` lemma is the "strong substitutivity" lemma of Shafer,
Tebbi, and Smolka (ITP 2015). The proofs of `par-triangle`, `strip`,
and `par-confluence` are based on the notion of complete development
by Takahashi (1995) and Pfenning's 1992 technical report about the
Church-Rosser theorem. In addition, we consulted Nipkow and
Berghofer's mechanization in Isabelle, which is based on an earlier
article by Nipkow (JAR 1996).
