## Introduction

You must do _all_ the exercises labelled "(recommended)".

Exercises labelled "(stretch)" are there to provide an extra challenge.
You don't need to do all of these, but should attempt at least a few.

Exercises labelled "(practice)" are included for those who want extra practice.

Submit your homework using the "submit" command.
Please ensure your files execute correctly under Agda!


## Good Scholarly Practice.

Please remember the University requirement as
regards all assessed work. Details about this can be found at:

> [http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct)

Furthermore, you are required to take reasonable measures to protect
your assessed work from unauthorised access. For example, if you put
any such work on a public repository then you must set access
permissions appropriately (generally permitting access only to
yourself, or your group in the case of group practicals).

## Lists

#### Exercise `reverse-++-distrib` (recommended)

Show that the reverse of one list appended to another is the
reverse of the second appended to the reverse of the first:

    reverse (xs ++ ys) ≡ reverse ys ++ reverse xs


#### Exercise `reverse-involutive` (recommended)

A function is an _involution_ if when applied twice it acts
as the identity function.  Show that reverse is an involution:

    reverse (reverse xs) ≡ xs


#### Exercise `map-compose` (practice)

Prove that the map of a composition is equal to the composition of two maps:

    map (g ∘ f) ≡ map g ∘ map f

The last step of the proof requires extensionality.

#### Exercise `map-++-distribute` (practice)

Prove the following relationship between map and append:

   map f (xs ++ ys) ≡ map f xs ++ map f ys

#### Exercise `map-Tree` (practice)

Define a type of trees with leaves of type `A` and internal
nodes of type `B`:
```
data Tree (A B : Set) : Set where
  leaf : A → Tree A B
  node : Tree A B → B → Tree A B → Tree A B
```
Define a suitable map operator over trees:
```
postulate
  map-Tree : ∀ {A B C D : Set}
    → (A → C) → (B → D) → Tree A B → Tree C D
```


#### Exercise `product` (recommended)

Use fold to define a function to find the product of a list of numbers.
For example:

    product [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] ≡ 24

```
-- Your code goes here
```

#### Exercise `foldr-++` (recommended)

Show that fold and append are related as follows:
```
postulate
  foldr-++ : ∀ {A B : Set} (_⊗_ : A → B → B) (e : B) (xs ys : List A) →
    foldr _⊗_ e (xs ++ ys) ≡ foldr _⊗_ (foldr _⊗_ e ys) xs
```


#### Exercise `map-is-foldr` (practice)

Show that map can be defined using fold:
```
postulate
  map-is-foldr : ∀ {A B : Set} {f : A → B} →
    map f ≡ foldr (λ x xs → f x ∷ xs) []
```
This requires extensionality.

#### Exercise `fold-Tree` (practice)

Define a suitable fold function for the type of trees given earlier:
```
postulate
  fold-Tree : ∀ {A B C : Set}
    → (A → C) → (C → B → C → C) → Tree A B → C
```

```
-- Your code goes here
```

#### Exercise `map-is-fold-Tree` (practice)

Demonstrate an analogue of `map-is-foldr` for the type of trees.

```
-- Your code goes here
```

#### Exercise `sum-downFrom` (stretch)

Define a function that counts down as follows:
```
downFrom : ℕ → List ℕ
downFrom zero     =  []
downFrom (suc n)  =  n ∷ downFrom n
```
For example:
```
_ : downFrom 3 ≡ [ 2 , 1 , 0 ]
_ = refl
```
Prove that the sum of the numbers `(n - 1) + ⋯ + 0` is
equal to `n * (n ∸ 1) / 2`:
```
postulate
  sum-downFrom : ∀ (n : ℕ)
    → sum (downFrom n) * 2 ≡ n * (n ∸ 1)
```


#### Exercise `foldl` (practice)

Define a function `foldl` which is analogous to `foldr`, but where
operations associate to the left rather than the right.  For example:

    foldr _⊗_ e [ x , y , z ]  =  x ⊗ (y ⊗ (z ⊗ e))
    foldl _⊗_ e [ x , y , z ]  =  ((e ⊗ x) ⊗ y) ⊗ z

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `foldr-monoid-foldl` (practice)

Show that if `_⊗_` and `e` form a monoid, then `foldr _⊗_ e` and
`foldl _⊗_ e` always compute the same result.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `Any-++-⇔` (recommended)

Prove a result similar to `All-++-⇔`, but with `Any` in place of `All`, and a suitable
replacement for `_×_`.  As a consequence, demonstrate an equivalence relating
`_∈_` and `_++_`.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `All-++-≃` (stretch)

Show that the equivalence `All-++-⇔` can be extended to an isomorphism.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `¬Any⇔All¬` (recommended)

Show that `Any` and `All` satisfy a version of De Morgan's Law:

    (¬_ ∘ Any P) xs ⇔ All (¬_ ∘ P) xs

(Can you see why it is important that here `_∘_` is generalised
to arbitrary levels, as described in the section on
[universe polymorphism](/Equality/#unipoly)?)

Do we also have the following?

    (¬_ ∘ All P) xs ⇔ Any (¬_ ∘ P) xs

If so, prove; if not, explain why.


```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `¬Any≃All¬` (stretch)

Show that the equivalence `¬Any⇔All¬` can be extended to an isomorphism.
You will need to use extensionality.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `All-∀` (practice)

Show that `All P xs` is isomorphic to `∀ {x} → x ∈ xs → P x`.

```
-- You code goes here
```


#### Exercise `Any-∃` (practice)

Show that `Any P xs` is isomorphic to `∃[ x ] (x ∈ xs × P x)`.

```
-- You code goes here
```


#### Exercise `any?` (stretch)

Just as `All` has analogues `all` and `All?` which determine whether a
predicate holds for every element of a list, so does `Any` have
analogues `any` and `Any?` which determine whether a predicate holds
for some element of a list.  Give their definitions.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `filter?` (stretch)

Define the following variant of the traditional `filter` function on lists,
which given a decidable predicate and a list returns all elements of the
list satisfying the predicate:
```
postulate
  filter? : ∀ {A : Set} {P : A → Set}
    → (P? : Decidable P) → List A → ∃[ ys ]( All P ys )
```



## Lambda

#### Exercise `mul` (recommended)

Write out the definition of a lambda term that multiplies
two natural numbers.  Your definition may use `plus` as
defined earlier.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `mulᶜ` (practice)

Write out the definition of a lambda term that multiplies
two natural numbers represented as Church numerals. Your
definition may use `plusᶜ` as defined earlier (or may not
— there are nice definitions both ways).

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `primed` (stretch) {#primed}

Some people find it annoying to write `` ` "x" `` instead of `x`.
We can make examples with lambda terms slightly easier to write
by adding the following definitions:
```
ƛ′_⇒_ : Term → Term → Term
ƛ′ (` x) ⇒ N  =  ƛ x ⇒ N
ƛ′ _ ⇒ _      =  ⊥-elim impossible
  where postulate impossible : ⊥

case′_[zero⇒_|suc_⇒_] : Term → Term → Term → Term → Term
case′ L [zero⇒ M |suc (` x) ⇒ N ]  =  case L [zero⇒ M |suc x ⇒ N ]
case′ _ [zero⇒ _ |suc _ ⇒ _ ]      =  ⊥-elim impossible
  where postulate impossible : ⊥

μ′_⇒_ : Term → Term → Term
μ′ (` x) ⇒ N  =  μ x ⇒ N
μ′ _ ⇒ _      =  ⊥-elim impossible
  where postulate impossible : ⊥
```
We intend to apply the function only when the first term is a variable, which we
indicate by postulating a term `impossible` of the empty type `⊥`.  If we use
C-c C-n to normalise the term

  ƛ′ two ⇒ two

Agda will return an answer warning us that the impossible has occurred:

  ⊥-elim (plfa.part2.Lambda.impossible (`` `suc (`suc `zero)) (`suc (`suc `zero)) ``)

While postulating the impossible is a useful technique, it must be
used with care, since such postulation could allow us to provide
evidence of _any_ proposition whatsoever, regardless of its truth.

The definition of `plus` can now be written as follows:
```
plus′ : Term
plus′ = μ′ + ⇒ ƛ′ m ⇒ ƛ′ n ⇒
          case′ m
            [zero⇒ n
            |suc m ⇒ `suc (+ · m · n) ]
  where
  +  =  ` "+"
  m  =  ` "m"
  n  =  ` "n"
```
Write out the definition of multiplication in the same style.


#### Exercise `_[_:=_]′` (stretch)

The definition of substitution above has three clauses (`ƛ`, `case`,
and `μ`) that invoke a `with` clause to deal with bound variables.
Rewrite the definition to factor the common part of these three
clauses into a single function, defined by mutual recursion with
substitution.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `—↠≲—↠′` (practice)

Show that the first notion of reflexive and transitive closure
above embeds into the second. Why are they not isomorphic?

```
-- Your code goes here
```

#### Exercise `plus-example` (practice)

Write out the reduction sequence demonstrating that one plus one is two.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `Context-≃` (practice)

Show that `Context` is isomorphic to `List (Id × Type)`.
For instance, the isomorphism relates the context

    ∅ , "s" ⦂ `ℕ ⇒ `ℕ , "z" ⦂ `ℕ

to the list

    [ ⟨ "z" , `ℕ ⟩ , ⟨ "s" , `ℕ ⇒ `ℕ ⟩ ]

```
-- Your code goes here
```

#### Exercise `mul-type` (recommended)

Using the term `mul` you defined earlier, write out the derivation
showing that it is well typed.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `mulᶜ-type` (practice)

Using the term `mulᶜ` you defined earlier, write out the derivation
showing that it is well typed.

```
-- Your code goes here
```



## Properties

#### Exercise `Progress-≃` (practice)

Show that `Progress M` is isomorphic to `Value M ⊎ ∃[ N ](M —→ N)`.

```
-- Your code goes here
```

#### Exercise `progress′` (practice)

Write out the proof of `progress′` in full, and compare it to the
proof of `progress` above.

```
-- Your code goes here
```

#### Exercise `value?` (practice)

Combine `progress` and `—→¬V` to write a program that decides
whether a well-typed term is a value:
```
postulate
  value? : ∀ {A M} → ∅ ⊢ M ⦂ A → Dec (Value M)
```

#### Exercise `subst′` (stretch)

Rewrite `subst` to work with the modified definition `_[_:=_]′`
from the exercise in the previous chapter.  As before, this
should factor dealing with bound variables into a single function,
defined by mutual recursion with the proof that substitution
preserves types.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `mul-eval` (recommended)

Using the evaluator, confirm that two times two is four.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise: `progress-preservation` (practice)

Without peeking at their statements above, write down the progress
and preservation theorems for the simply typed lambda-calculus.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `subject_expansion` (practice)

We say that `M` _reduces_ to `N` if `M —→ N`,
but we can also describe the same situation by saying
that `N` _expands_ to `M`.
The preservation property is sometimes called _subject reduction_.
Its opposite is _subject expansion_, which holds if
`M —→ N` and `∅ ⊢ N ⦂ A` imply `∅ ⊢ M ⦂ A`.
Find two counter-examples to subject expansion, one
with case expressions and one not involving case expressions.

```
-- Your code goes here
```


#### Exercise `stuck` (practice)

Give an example of an ill-typed term that does get stuck.

```
-- Your code goes here
```

#### Exercise `unstuck` (recommended)

Provide proofs of the three postulates, `unstuck`, `preserves`, and `wttdgs` above.

```
-- Your code goes here
```
