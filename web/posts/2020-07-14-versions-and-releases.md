We’re adding stable releases to PLFA, which you can find [on GitHub][plfa-releases]!

<!--more-->

For the past two years, we’ve tried to do major revisions of the book during winter break and early summer, to ensure that the text remains consistent throughout the teaching period… Inevitably, we fixed bugs, and make small changes here and there, perhaps resulting in a less-than-consistent experience.

Starting today, you can be sure that PLFA will remain consistent, since we’re adding stable releases! You can find the releases [on GitHub][plfa-releases], and as tags in the Git repository. The releases are numbered using [calendar versioning][calver] using the `v0Y.0M` format, _e.g._, v20.07 was released in July 2020. Each release will be available indefinitely. For instance, if you’d like to browse PLFA version v20.07, just go to: <https://plfa.github.io/20.07/>
