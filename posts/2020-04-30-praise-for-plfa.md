[*Types and Semantics for Programming Languages*][TSPL-2019], the course we teach in Edinburgh, was shortlisted as an Outstanding Course by the [Edinburgh University Student Association][EUSA-2020] (Runner Up)!

> “Types and Semantics for Programming Languages was the single best course I took throughout my time at the University of Edinburgh. Philip Wadler clearly poured his heart into teaching it, including writing a whole textbook including exercises specifically for the course.”

> “One of the most inspiring courses. Philip designed a course that is both very theoretical and very practical.”
