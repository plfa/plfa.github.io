## Assignments

You must do _all_ the exercises labelled "(recommended)".

Exercises labelled "(stretch)" are there to provide an extra challenge.
You don't need to do all of these, but should attempt at least a few.

Exercises without a label are optional, and may be done if you want
some extra practice.
